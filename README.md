# MSSD
1. The input of MSSD is a set of gene trees. And gene trees must be rooted gene trees in Newick format. Gene trees need to be separated by semicolons. The input sample is the trees.txt.
2. The experimental data of MSSD is divided into real data(real_dataset.zip) and simulated data(ReconD.zip).
3. There are two ways to run MSSD:


    A.Run MSSD.jar under the root directory.
    
    
    B.Run source code directly - MSSD folder.
    
    
Typing full path of gene trees file is required. And the console will print the constructed network.
